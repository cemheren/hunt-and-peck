# hunt-n-peck-v2
this repo improves upon the original hunt-and-peck repo. 

Additions
1. Added a caching layer that helps with perceived performance. Still only viable in powerful desktop computers.
2. Added a state machine similar to to vim - f, i, j and k keys. 
3. Some mouse operations. 
4. Code cleanup. 
5. Some visual changes on how the hints are displayed. 
6. Removed randomness on hints that was annoying me. 

There are some bugs on the caching side I'm working on now. 
Mainly maintaining this project because it helps with the carpal tunnel pain (not using mouse)
